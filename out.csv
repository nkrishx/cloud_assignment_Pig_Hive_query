Later on  it is retrieved via ajax  and its value is filled in.Question is  how can I watch for the value of someField to be updated When I do this from the link methodscope.watchscope.model  function   console.log changed  new val   scope.model This is only called once  when initalizing the directive  and the value then is empty. When the value is retrieved via ajax from http.get  this watch function is not called again. However  in other parts of the page where Im displaying someField  that value DOES update when ajax request is fetched. So I dont think the problem has to do with doing scope.apply after ajax request.Edit someField is assigned in the controller. Here is the codeMyApp.controllermyCtrl  scope  rootScope  routeParams  ajax  filter functionscope  rootScope  routeParams  ajax  filter    var userId  parseInt routeParams.userId             scope.loaded  false    scope.someField   initalize with empty value    var load  functiondata            scope.loaded  true        scope.someField  data.someField                            ajax.getUseruserId.successload               The method ajax.getUser does a http.get and returns its promise.

Im using the PrettyTime java library for a variety of datetime processing in my java app  such as converting MySQL format datesdatetime strings into java dates  or the vice versa.However  I see that date.getYear  date.getMonth  etc  are all deprecated  and it says to use Calendar instead.  But PrettyTime only returns its results as Date objects  and I see no way to convert the Date objects into calendar objects.In the documentation for Calendar  the only mention I see of Date is the method setTimeDate date  but the method name is ambigious  and the documentation is not clear on what calling this method would actually do. Obviously I cant just do calendar.set date.getYear  date.getMonth  .. etc  as those methods of Date are deprecated.So how can I convert a given Date object to Calendar ,How to convert java.util.Date objects into Calendar objects,49153

How can I make xargs execute the command exactly once for each line of input givenIts default behavior is to chunk the lines and execute the command once  passing multiple lines to each instance.   From httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiXargs     find path type f print0 | xargs 0 rm    In this example  find feeds the input of xargs with a long list of file names. xargs then splits this list into sublists and calls rm once for every sublist. This is more efficient than this functionally equivalent version    find path type f exec rm  I know that find has the exec flag.

Short QuestionWhat is the proper way to install pip  virtualenv  and distributeBackgroundIn my answer to SO question 4314376  I recommended using ez_setup so that you could then install pip and virtualenv as followscurl O httppeak.telecommunity.comdistez_setup.pysudo python ez_setup.pysudo easy_install pipsudo pip install virtualenvI originally pulled these instructions from Jesse Nollers blog post So you want to use Python on the Mac. I like the idea of keeping a clean global sitepackages directory  so the only other packages I install there are  virtualenvwrapper and distribute. I recently added distribute to my toolbox because of this Python public service announcement. To install these two packages  I usedsudo pip install virtualenvwrappercurl O httppythondistribute.orgdistribute_setup.pysudo python distribute_setup.pyNo more setuptools and easy_installTo really follow that Python public service announcement  on a fresh Python install  I would do the followingcurl O httppythondistribute.orgdistribute_setup.pysudo python distribute_setup.pysudo easy_install pipsudo pip install virtualenvsudo pip install virtualenvwrapperGlyphs RebukeIn a comment to my answer to SO question 4314376  SO user Glyph stated  NO. NEVER EVER do sudo python setup.py install whatever. Write a .pydistutils.cfg that puts your pip installation into .local or something. Especially files named ez_setup.py tend to suck down newer versions of things like setuptools and easy_install  which can potentially break other things on your operating system.Back to the short questionSo Glyphs response leads me to my original questionWhat is the proper way to install pip  virtualenv  and distribute,Whats the proper way to install pip  virtualenv  and distribute for Python,95592

In HTML5  I know that ltnavgt can be used either inside or outside the pages masthead  ltheadergt element. For websites having both secondary and main navigation  it seems common to include the secondary navigation as a ltnavgt element inside the masthead ltheadergt element with the main navigation as a ltnavgt element outside the masthead ltheadergt element.  However  if the website lacks secondary navigation  it appears common to include the main navigation in a ltnavgt element within the masthead ltheadergt element.If I follow these examples  my content structure will be based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigation. This introduces a coupling between the content and the style that feels unnecessary and unnatural.Is there a better way so that Im not moving the main navigation from inside to outside the masthead ltheadergt element based on the inclusion or exclusion of secondary navigationMain and Secondary Navigation Exampleltheadergt    ltnavgt        lt Secondary Navigation inside ltheadergt gt        ltulgt            ltligtltligt        ltulgt    ltnavgt    lth1gtWebsite Titlelth1gtltheadergtltnavgt    lt Main Navigation outside ltheadergt gt    ltulgt        ltligtltligt    ltulgtltnavgtOnlineDegrees.org is an example site that follows the above pattern.Main Only Navigation Exampleltheadergt    lth1gtWebsite Titlelth1gt    ltnavgt        lt Main Navigation inside ltheadergt gt        ltulgt            ltligtltligt        ltulgt    ltnavgtltheadergtKeyzo.co.uk is an example site that follows the above pattern.Excerpts from Introducing HTML5 — Added on 02Feb11  738 AMIntroducing HTML5 by Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp has this to say about the subject  The header can also contain navigation. This can be very useful for sitewide navigation  especially on templatedriven sites where the whole of the ltheadergt element could come from a template file.    Of course  its not required that the ltnavgt be in the ltheadergt.    If depends largely on whether you believe the sitewide navigation belongs in the sitewide header and also pragmatic considerations about ease of styling.Based on that last sentence  it appears that Bruce Lawson—author of the chapter those excerpts are from—admits that pragmatic considerations about ease of styling yield a coupling between the content and the style.,In HTML5  should the main navigation be inside or outside the  element,95592

I have to build an url dynamically according to the current url. Using the  url  tag is the easiest way to do it  but I need the current url name to generate the new one dynamically. How can I get the url name attached to the urlconf that leads to the current viewEDIT  I know I can manually handcraft the url using get_absolute_url but Id rather avoid it since its part of a lecture and I would like to demonstrate only one way to build urls.The students know how to use  url . They are know facing a problem when they have to generate a more complete url based on the current one. The easiest way is to use  url  again  with some variations.
